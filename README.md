# Netwhat-calculator

## Getting Started

### Installing

git clone https://github.com/lcols19/Netwhat-calculator.git


### Running the tests

Two scripts are available to help : nbr_adr and tobinary. ntw_adr is not ready as of now.

nbr_adr : gives the number of host addresses available on a LAN attached to a given IP address.<br>
The argument is the CIDR number of this IP address.

tobinary : takes a decimal number, turns it into a binary.<br>
The argument is the decimal writing of the octet.

ntw_adr(BETA currently working on it) : gives the range within which a given IP address could communicate with another one.<br>
The argument is the IP address with the CIDR.

To run any script, type "sh [name-of-the-script].sh [argument]"

## Notes

These scripts have been done in order not to waste time on questions. Don't use this calculator if you don't understand any formulas behind it.<br>
I have yet to find a way to tell the exact adress of the network from the IP address of a router.<br>
Please report any issue you encountered.
